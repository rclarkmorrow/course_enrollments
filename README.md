# Course Enrollments

This is an API developed as the capstone project for Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree. It's a minimal course enrollment application that is able to enroll students in courses and assign instructors to courses. I chose this path for the project because I wanted to work with a couple of many-to-many relationships that might require data validation to avoid things like scheduling conflicts, duplicate emails, bad emails and bad phone numbers. This also allowed me to explore more extensive unittesting that requried for previous course projects.

Details on accessing, running or testing the API can be found at:
